    "Horsea makes its home in oceans with gentle currents. If this Pok\u00e9mon is under attack, it spits out pitch-black ink and escapes.",
    "They swim with dance-like motions and cause whirlpools to form. Horsea compete to see which of them can generate the biggest whirlpool.",
    "Known to shoot down flying bugs with precision blasts of ink from the surface of the water.",
    "It makes its nest in the shade of corals. If it senses danger, it spits murky ink and flees.",
    "Horsea eats small insects and moss off of rocks. If the ocean current turns fast, this Pok\u00e9mon anchors itself by wrapping its tail around rocks or coral to prevent being washed away.",
    "Its big, developed fins move rapidly, allowing it to swim backward while still facing forward.",
    "If attacked by a larger enemy, it quickly swims to safety by adeptly controlling its dorsal fin.",
    "When they're in a safe location, they can be seen playfully tangling their tails together.",
    "If it senses any danger, it will vigorously spray water or a special type of ink from its mouth.",
    "It maintains balance using its tail, which is wound up like a coil. It may spray ink from its mouth.",
    "If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pok\u00e9mon swims by cleverly flapping the fins on its back.",
    "By cleverly flicking the fins on its back side to side, it moves in any direction while facing forward. It spits ink to escape if it senses danger.",
    "If Horsea senses danger, it will reflexively spray a dense black ink from its mouth and try to escape. This Pok\u00e9mon swims by cleverly flapping the fin on its back.",
    "If attacked by a larger enemy, it quickly swims to safety by adeptly controlling its well-developed dorsal fin."
