    "A bit of a dandy, it spends its free time preening its wings. Its preoccupation with any dirt on its plumage can leave it unable to battle.",
    "Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power\u2014presumably due to the frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set into its wings are keen as ever.",
    "It throws sharp feathers called blade quills at enemies or prey. It seldom misses.",
    "It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.",
    "This narcissistic Pok\u00e9mon is a clean freak. If you don\u2019t groom it diligently, it will stop listening to you.",
    "It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.",
    "Supremely sensitive to the presence of others, it can detect opponents standing behind it, flinging its sharp feathers to take them out."
