    "Even while under careful observation, large flocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably disappear from view.",
    "It carries people and Pok\u00e9mon when it flies. But since it only drifts, it can end up anywhere.",
    "It\u2019s drowzy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go.",
    "It drifts along at dusk, perfectly silent. Its transient, melancholy aspect touches some people deeply\u2014every so often, one will come upon a song or poem devoted to Drifblim.",
    "There was once an incident in which a man took a trip riding a Drifblim, only to go missing.",
    "There\u2019s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you\u2019ll be carried away to the afterlife.",
    "It can generate and release gas within its body. That\u2019s how it can control the altitude of its drift.",
    "The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it\u2019s thought to carry away people and Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "It\u2019s drowsy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go.",
    "It grabs people and Pok\u00e9mon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows.",
    "They carry people and Pok\u00e9mon, but the wind can catch them, so there can\u2019t be a fixed destination.",
    "At dusk, swarms of them are carried aloft on winds. When noticed, they suddenly vanish.",
    "Some say this Pok\u00e9mon is a collection of souls burdened with regrets, silently drifting through the dusk."
