    "These Pok\u00e9mon have sharp fangs and powerful jaws. Sailors avoid Carvanha dens at all costs.",
    "It lives in massive rivers that course through jungles. It swarms prey that enter its territory.",
    "If they scent the faintest trace of blood, they rush to attack en masse. When alone, they\u2019re rather cowardly.",
    "Carvanha attack ships in swarms, making them sink. Although it is said to be a very vicious Pok\u00e9mon, it timidly flees as soon as it finds itself alone.",
    "With its sturdy jaws and fangs, it can easily chomp wooden boats to splinters. It fights with Basculin over food.",
    "Carvanha\u2019s strongly developed jaws and its sharply pointed fangs pack the destructive power to rip out boat hulls. Many boats have been attacked and sunk by this Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "They swarm any foe that invades their territory. Their sharp fangs can tear out boat hulls.",
    "Each school has its own territory. Any intruders are mercilessly attacked with fangs bared.",
    "They form packs to attack boats and rip out their hulls to sink them. They live in rivers in the jungle.",
    "They\u2019re such cowards that they won\u2019t hunt alone. When five or so of them get together, they suddenly turn ferocious!",
    "If anything invades Carvanha\u2019s territory, it will swarm and tear at the intruder with its pointed fangs. On its own, however, this Pok\u00e9mon turns suddenly timid.",
    "It won\u2019t attack while it\u2019s alone\u2014not even if it spots prey. Instead, it waits for other Carvanha to join it, and then the Pok\u00e9mon attack as a group."
