    "Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground.",
    "If you find its nest, you shouldn\u2019t stick your hand inside. You\u2019ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin.",
    "It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap.",
    "They often gather near places frequented by electric Pok\u00e9mon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches.",
    "It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
