    "While it can guard against any sort of attack from the front, it is left without recourse when attacked from behind.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon is from roughly 100 million years ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder than steel.",
    "Its face is sturdy\u2014as strong as diamond\u2014and this hardness offers a very stable defense. Much about this species is still unknown, such as its natural habitat.",
    "When attacked, they form a wall with their shieldlike faces to protect their young.",
    "When attacked, they form a wall. Their rock-hard faces serve to protect them from the attacks.",
    "Any frontal attack is repulsed. It is a docile Pok\u00e9mon that feeds on grass and berries.",
