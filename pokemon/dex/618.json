    "For some reason, this Pok\u00e9mon smiles slightly when it emits a strong electric current from the yellow markings on its body.",
    "Its skin is very hard, so it is unhurt even if stepped on by sumo wrestlers. It smiles when transmitting electricity.",
    "Thanks to bacteria that lived in the mud flats with it, this Pok\u00e9mon developed the organs it uses to generate electricity.",
    "It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt of electricity.",
    "When its opponent can\u2019t be paralyzed, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away."
