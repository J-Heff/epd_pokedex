    "The world\u2019s laziest Pok\u00e9mon. It moves to another spot when there\u2019s no food left within its reach.",
    "Slaking spends all day lying down and lolling about. It eats grass growing within its reach. If it eats all the grass it can reach, this Pok\u00e9mon reluctantly moves to another spot.",
    "Wherever Slaking live, rings of over a yard in diameter appear in grassy fields. They are made by the Pok\u00e9mon as it eats all the grass within reach while lying prone on the ground.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon lives lying on its side. It only rolls over and moves when there is no more grass to eat.",
    "The world\u2019s laziest Pok\u00e9mon. When it is lounging, it is actually saving energy for striking back.",
    "Hordes of Slaking gather around trees when fruits come into season. They wait around patiently for ripened fruits to fall out of the trees.",
    "It is the world\u2019s most slothful Pok\u00e9mon. However, it can exert horrifying power by releasing pent-up energy all at once."
