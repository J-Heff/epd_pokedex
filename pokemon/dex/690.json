    "Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies.",
    "Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off.",
    "It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pok\u00e9mon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead.",
    "It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution.",
    "It\u2019s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it\u2019s often found near Dhelmise.",
    "It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pok\u00e9mon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source."
