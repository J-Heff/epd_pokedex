    "Amoonguss generally doesn\u2019t move much. It tends to stand still near Pok\u00e9 Balls that have been dropped on the ground.",
    "It lures prey close by dancing and waving its arm caps, which resemble Pok\u00e9 Balls, in a swaying motion.",
    "They show off their Pok\u00e9 Ball caps to lure prey, but very few Pok\u00e9mon are fooled by this.",
    "It moves the caps on both arms and does a dance to lure prey. It prefers damp places.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon puffs poisonous spores at its foes. If the spores aren\u2019t washed off quickly, they\u2019ll grow into mushrooms wherever they land."
