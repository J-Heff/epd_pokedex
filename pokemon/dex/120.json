    "Large numbers of these Pok\u00e9mon make their home at the seaside. At night, a strange red glow radiates from the center of their bodies.",
    "It appears in large numbers by seashores. At night, its central core flashes with a red light.",
    "As long as the center section is unharmed, this Pok\u00e9mon can grow back fully even if it is chopped to bits.",
    "As long as the center section is unharmed, it can grow back fully even if it is chopped to bits.",
    "Even if its body is torn, it can regenerate as long as the glowing central core remains intact.",
    "At night, the center of its body slowly flickers with the same rhythm as a human heartbeat.",
    "If its body is torn, it can grow back if the red core remains. The core flashes at midnight.",
    "An enigmatic Pok\u00e9mon that can effortlessly regenerate any appendage it loses in battle.",
    "Fish Pok\u00e9mon nibble at it, but Staryu isn\u2019t bothered. Its body regenerates quickly, even if part of it is completely torn off.",
    "When the stars twinkle at night, it floats up from the sea floor, and its body's center core flickers.",
    "As long as its red core remains, it can regenerate its body instantly, even if it\u2019s torn apart.",
    "Staryu\u2019s center section has an organ called the core that shines bright red. If you go to a beach toward the end of summer, the glowing cores of these Pok\u00e9mon look like the stars in the sky.",
    "At night, the middle of its body slowly flickers with the same rhythm as a human heartbeat.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon gets nibbled on by Lumineon and others. Thanks to its red core, it regenerates fast, so it\u2019s unconcerned by their snack attacks.",
    "It gathers with others in the night and makes its red core glow on and off with the twinkling stars. It can regenerate limbs if they are severed from its body.",
    "No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its amazing regenerative powers return it to its previous state in half a day!",
    "If you visit a beach at the end of summer, you\u2019ll be able to see groups of Staryu lighting up in a steady rhythm.",
    "In many places, there are folktales of stardust falling into the ocean and becoming Staryu.",
    "Staryu apparently communicates with the stars in the night sky by flashing the red core at the center of its body. If parts of its body are torn, this Pok\u00e9mon simply regenerates the missing pieces and limbs."
