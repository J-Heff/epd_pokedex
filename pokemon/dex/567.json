    "They hunted in flocks. When one Archeops had the prey cornered, another would swoop on it.",
    "Though capable of flight, Archeops was apparently better at hunting on the ground.",
    "Said to be an ancestor of bird Pok\u00e9mon, the muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak, so it needs a long runway in order to take off.",
    "It runs better than it flies. It takes off into the sky by running at a speed of 25 mph.",
    "Although apparently able to fly, they tended to run along the ground, averaging speeds of roughly 25 mph.",
    "It needs a running start to take off. If Archeops wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph, building speed over a course of about 2. 5 miles.",
    "They are intelligent and will cooperate to catch prey. From the ground, they use a running start to take flight.",
    "This ancient Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s plumage is delicate, so if anyone other than an experienced professional tries to restore it, they will fail.",
    "It runs better than it flies. It catches prey by running at speeds comparable to those of an automobile."
