    "They live hidden under hot desert sands in order to keep their body temperature from dropping.",
    "It submerges itself in sand and moves as if swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies from finding it and maintains its temperature.",
    "It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch.",
    "Alola, where it\u2019s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pok\u00e9mon. Sometimes you\u2019ll even see it outside of deserts.",
    "Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it\u2019s swimming.",
    "It moves along below the sand\u2019s surface, except for its nose and eyes. A dark membrane shields its eyes from the sun.",
    "Sandile\u2019s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It\u2019s called \u201cthe cleaner of the desert. \u201d",
    "They live buried in the sands of the desert. The sun-warmed sands prevent their body temperature from dropping.",
    "The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun sets, this Pok\u00e9mon burrows deep into the sand and sleeps until sunrise."
