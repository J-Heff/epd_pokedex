    "It likes places where people gather. It mimics foes to confuse them, then makes its getaway.",
    "It habitually mimics foes. Once mimicked, the foe cannot take its eyes off this Pok\u00e9mon.",

    "It looks for a Mr. Rime that\u2019s a good dancer and carefully copies the Mr. Rime\u2019s steps like an apprentice.",
    "It mimics everyone it sees, but it puts extra effort into copying the graceful dance steps of Mr. Rime as practice.",
    "It does its absolute best to mimic the movements and expressions of its opponents, but it\u2019s still not very good at it."
