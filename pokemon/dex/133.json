    "The question of why only Eevee has such unstable genes has still not been solved.",
    "It has the ability to alter the composition of its body to suit its surrounding environment.",
    "Its ability to evolve into many forms allows it to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment.",
    "Current studies show it can evolve into an incredible eight different species of Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Possessing an unbalanced and unstable genetic makeup, it conceals many possible evolutions.",
    "Its genes are easily influenced by its surroundings. Even its face starts to look like that of its Trainer.",
    "Its genetic code is irregular. It may mutate if it is exposed to radiation from element STONEs.",
    "An extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon that may evolve in a number of different ways depending on stimuli.",
    "Harbors the potential to evolve into manifold forms. Within Eevee lies the key to the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon evolution\u2014I'm certain of it.",
    "Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates due to the environment in which it lives. Radiation from various STONES causes this Pok\u00e9mon to evolve.",
    "It can evolve into a variety of forms. Eevee\u2019s genes are the key to solving the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon evolution.",
    "Its genetic code is irregular. It may mutate if it is exposed to radiation from element STONES.",
    "Thanks to its unstable genetic makeup, this special Pok\u00e9mon conceals many different possible evolutions.",
    "A rare Pok\u00e9mon that adapts to harsh environments by taking on different evolutionary forms.",
    "Because its genetic makeup is irregular, it quickly changes its form due to a variety of causes.",
    "Its irregularly configured DNA is affected by its surroundings. It evolves if its environment changes.",
    "Its genetic code is unstable, so it could evolve in a variety of ways. There are only a few alive.",
    "An Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates due to its environment. Radiation from various STONES causes this Pok\u00e9mon to evolve.",
    "Eevee has an unstable genetic makeup that suddenly mutates due to the environment in which it lives. Radiation from various stones causes this Pok\u00e9mon to evolve."
