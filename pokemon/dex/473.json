    "Its impressive tusks are made of ice. The population thinned when it turned warm after the ice age.",
    "A frozen Mamoswine was dug from ice dating back 10,000 years. This Pok\u00e9mon has been around a long, long, long time.",
    "A frozen one was dug up from soil dating back 10,000 years. It woke up to much amazement.",
    "This species reached its zenith during the period known as the ice age. I suspect that Hisui's frigid climate is in harmony with Mamoswine's constitution, thus awakening hidden potential.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon can be spotted in wall paintings from as far back as 10,000 years ago. For a while, it was thought to have gone extinct.",
    "It looks strong, and that\u2019s exactly what it is. As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks grow longer, thicker, and more impressive.",
    "It flourished worldwide during the ice age but its population declined when the masses of ice began to dwindle.",
    "When the temperature rose at the end of the ice age, most Mamoswine disappeared."
