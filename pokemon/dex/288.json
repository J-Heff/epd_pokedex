    "Its heart beats at a tenfold tempo, so it cannot sit still for even a moment.",
    "Vigoroth is simply incapable of remaining still. Even when it tries to sleep, the blood in its veins grows agitated, compelling this Pok\u00e9mon to run wild throughout the jungle before it can settle down.",
    "It can\u2019t keep still because its blood boils with energy. It runs through the fields and mountains all day to calm itself. If it doesn\u2019t, it can\u2019t sleep at night.",
    "Its stress level rises if it cannot keep moving constantly. Too much stress makes it feel sick.",
    "Vigoroth is always itching and agitated to go on a wild rampage. It simply can\u2019t tolerate sitting still for even a minute. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s stress level rises if it can\u2019t be moving constantly.",
    "It is always hungry because it won\u2019t stop rampaging. Even while it is eating, it can\u2019t keep still.",
    "Its heartbeat is fast and its blood so agitated that it can\u2019t sit still for one second."
