    "Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they\u2019re cut off. After a good night\u2019s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal.",
    "It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.",
    "Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious.",
    "The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it\u2019s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.",
    "It\u2019s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola\u2019s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off."
