    "Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes\u2019 movements and make fools of them.",
    "It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it\u2019s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom.",
    "Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur\u2019s pollen.",
    "Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers.",
    "Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food.",
    "An opponent\u2019s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent\u2019s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back."
