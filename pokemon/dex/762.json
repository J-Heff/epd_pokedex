    "The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird Pok\u00e9mon, this Pok\u00e9mon is totally fine.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon is always bouncing around energetically. Other Pok\u00e9mon are attracted by its lively appearance and pleasant aroma.",
    "Any Corvisquire that pecks at this Pok\u00e9mon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick.",
    "As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will feel a surge of happiness.",
    "It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They\u2019re quite painful when they smack you!",
    "It\u2019s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pok\u00e9mon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn\u2019t care."
