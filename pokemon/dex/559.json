    "It immediately headbutts anyone that makes eye contact with it. Its skull is massively thick.",

    "It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to protect itself. The saggier their skin, the more respect they garner.",
    "Proud of its sturdy skull, it suddenly headbutts everything, but its weight makes it unstable, too.",
    "Its skin has a rubbery elasticity, so it can reduce damage by defensively pulling its skin up to its neck.",
    "It protects itself with its durable skin. It\u2019s thought that this Pok\u00e9mon will evolve once its skin has completely stretched out.",
    "They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt."
