    "Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is apparently due to the incompetence of the engineer who updated its programming.",
    "Its programming was modified to enable work in alien dimensions. It did not work as planned.",
    "A curious item induced this evolution. The Pok\u00e9mon's offensive capabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its behavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me.",
    "Porygon-Z had a program installed to allow it to move between dimensions, but the program also caused instability in Porygon-Z\u2019s behavior.",
    "A faulty update was added to its programming. Its behavior is noticeably strange, so the experiment may have been a failure.",
    "Its programming was modified to enable it to travel through alien dimensions. Seems there might have been an error. ..",
    "Additional software was installed to make it a better Pok\u00e9mon. It began acting oddly, however.",
    "Its program was modified to facilitate extra-dimensional activities, but that led to noticeably strange behavior.",
    "In order to create a more advanced Pok\u00e9mon, an additional program was installed, but apparently it contained a defect that makes it move oddly.",
    "Some say an additional program made this Pok\u00e9mon evolve, but even academics can\u2019t agree on whether Porygon-Z is really an evolution."
