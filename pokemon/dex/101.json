    "One of Electrode\u2019s characteristics is its attraction to electricity. It is a problematical Pok\u00e9mon that congregates mostly at electrical power plants to feed on electricity that has just been generated.",
    "The more energy it charges up, the faster it gets. But this also makes it more likely to explode.",
    "It is dangerous. If it has too much electricity and has nothing to do, it amuses itself by exploding.",
    "They appear in great numbers at electric power plants. Because they feed on electricity, they cause massive and chaotic blackouts in nearby cities.",
    "It stores electric energy under very high pressure. It often explodes with little or no provocation.",
    "It explodes in response to even minor stimuli. It is feared, with the nickname of \u201cThe Bomb Ball. \u201d",
    "The tissue on the surface of its body is curiously similar in composition to an Apricorn. When irritated, this Pok\u00e9mon lets loose an electric current equal to 20 lightning bolts.",
    "Stores electrical energy inside its body. Even the slightest shock could trigger a huge explosion.",
    "It is known to drift on winds if it is bloated to bursting with stored electricity.",
    "It stores an overflowing amount of electric energy inside its body. Even a small shock makes it explode.",
    "Electrode eats electricity in the atmosphere. On days when lightning strikes, you can see this Pok\u00e9mon exploding all over the place from eating too much electricity."
