    "Instead of blood, a powerful magnetic force courses throughout Beldum\u2019s body. This Pok\u00e9mon communicates with others by sending controlled pulses of magnetism.",

    "It uses magnetic waves to converse with its kind. All the cells in its body are magnetic.",
    "Its cells are all magnetic, and it communicates with others by using magnetic pulses.",
    "If you anger it, it will do more than rampage. It will also burst out strong magnetism, causing nearby machines to break.",
    "When Beldum gather in a swarm, they move in perfect unison as if they were but one Pok\u00e9mon. They communicate with each other using brain waves.",
    "Beldum keeps itself floating by generating a magnetic force that repels earth\u2019s natural magnetism. When it sleeps, this Pok\u00e9mon anchors itself to a cliff using the hooks on its rear.",
    "Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its body. When it\u2019s feeling bad, try giving it a magnet.",
    "With magnetic traction, it pulls its opponents in close. When they\u2019re in range, it slashes them with its rear claws.",
    "From its rear, Beldum emits a magnetic force that rapidly pulls opponents in. They get skewered on Beldum\u2019s sharp claws.",
    "The cells in this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body are composed of magnetic material. Instead of blood, magnetic forces flow through Beldum\u2019s body.",

    "The magnetic force generated by its body repels the ground\u2019s natural magnetism, letting it float."
