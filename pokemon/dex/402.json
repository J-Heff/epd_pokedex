    "There is a village that hosts a contest based on the amazingly variable cries of this Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "By allowing its cry to resonate in the hollow of its belly, it produces a captivating sound.",
    "It signals its emotions with its melodies. Scientists are studying these melodic patterns.",
    "It crosses its knifelike arms in front of its chest when it cries. It can compose melodies ad lib.",
    "It uses its cutlass-like arms to produce sound, the melody of which varies from individual to individual. It is a worthwhile endeavor to seek out one's favorite tunes."
