    "In rare cases, it molts and sheds its scales. Medicine containing its scales as an ingredient will make a weary body feel invigorated.",
    "It loves sparkly things. It seeks treasures in caves and hoards the loot in its nest.",
    "Shiny objects are its passion. It can be found in its cave, scarcely moving, its gaze fixed on the jewels it\u2019s amassed or Carbink it has caught.",
    "There is a long-held belief that medicine made from its scales will heal even incurable illnesses.",
    "It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye trying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes furiously angry and attacks the Sableye.",
    "It habitually digs up and hoards gems in its nest. Its loot is constantly targeted by thieves.",
    "It sheds its skin and gradually grows larger. Its scales can be ground into a powder and used as raw materials for traditional medicine.",
