    "It gulps anything that fits in its mouth. Its special enzymes can dissolve anything.",
    "When Swalot spots prey, it spurts out a hideously toxic fluid from its pores and sprays the target. Once the prey has weakened, this Pok\u00e9mon gulps it down whole with its cavernous mouth.",
    "Swalot has no teeth, so what it eats, it swallows whole, no matter what. Its cavernous mouth yawns widely. An automobile tire could easily fit inside this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s mouth.",
    "It can swallow a tire whole in one gulp. It secretes a horribly toxic fluid from the pores on its body.",
    "It swallows anything whole. It sweats toxic fluids from its follicles to douse foes.",
    "Its powerful stomach acid is capable of digesting almost anything. The one thing in the whole world a Swalot can\u2019t digest is its own stomach."
