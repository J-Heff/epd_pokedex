    "The energy made in its cheeks\u2019 electric pouches is stored inside its membrane and released while it is gliding.",
    "They store up electricity to fly through the air. When thunder cracks at night, sometimes there are almost enough of them to blot out the sky.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon absolutely loves sweet berries. Sometimes it stuffs its cheeks full of so much food that it can\u2019t fly properly.",
    "As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird Pok\u00e9mon keep their distance. That\u2019s why Emolga can keep all its food to itself.",
    "It grills berries and bug Pok\u00e9mon with electric shocks and makes a meal of them. It usually nests in the holes gouged in trees by Pikipek.",
    "As Emolga flutters through the air, it crackles with electricity. This Pok\u00e9mon is cute, but it can cause a lot of trouble.",
    "It glides on its outstretched membrane while shocking foes with the electricity stored in the pouches on its cheeks."
