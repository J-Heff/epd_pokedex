    "Although it still can\u2019t fly, its jumping power is outstanding. It jumps way up into trees and plucks the buds from the branches.",
    "Natu has a highly developed jumping ability. The Pok\u00e9mon flaps and leaps onto tree branches that are taller than grown-up people to pick at the tree\u2019s new shoots.",
    "The look in its eyes gives the impression that it\u2019s carefully observing you. If you approach it, Natu will hop away.",
    "Natu cannot fly because its wings are not yet fully grown. If your eyes meet with this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s eyes, it will stare back intently at you. But if you move even slightly, it will hop away to safety.",
    "It usually forages for food on the ground but may, on rare occasions, hop onto branches to peck at shoots.",
    "It runs up short trees that grow on the savanna to peck at new shoots. A Natu\u2019s eyes look as if they are always observing something.",
    "It picks food from cactus plants, deftly avoiding buds and spines. It seems to skip about to move.",
    "Because its wings aren't yet fully grown, it has to hop to get around. It is always staring at something.",
    "Because its wings aren\u2019t yet fully grown, it has to hop to get around. It is always staring at something.",
    "It is extremely good at climbing tree trunks and likes to eat the new sprouts on the trees."
