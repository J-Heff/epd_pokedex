    "With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater\u2014or even air\u2014right in two.",
    "It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs.",
    "They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner\u2019s meal.",
    "The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pok\u00e9mon will do anything it takes to win.",
    "Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod.",
    "It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea."
