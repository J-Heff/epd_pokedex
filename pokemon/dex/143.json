    "It doesn\u2019t do anything other than eat and sleep. When prompted to make a serious effort, though, it apparently displays awesome power.",
    "It stops eating only to sleep. It doesn\u2019t feel full unless it eats nearly 900 pounds a day.",
    "Its stomach is said to be incomparably strong. Even Muk\u2019s poison is nothing more than a hint of spice on Snorlax\u2019s tongue.",
    "Its stomach\u2019s digestive juices can dissolve any kind of poison. It can even eat things off the ground.",

    "It is not satisfied unless it eats over 880 pounds of food every day. When it is done eating, it goes promptly to sleep.",
    "This glutton appears in villages without warning and devours the entirety of their rice granaries\u2014such occurrences have long been counted among the gravest of disasters.",
    "Very lazy. Just eats and sleeps. As its rotund bulk builds, it becomes steadily more slothful.",
    "When its belly is full, it becomes too lethargic to even lift a finger, so it is safe to bounce on its belly.",
    "Snorlax\u2019s typical day consists of nothing more than eating and sleeping. It is such a docile Pok\u00e9mon that there are children who use its expansive belly as a place to play.",
    "What sounds like its cry may actually be its snores or the rumblings of its hungry belly.",
    "Its stomach can digest any kind of food, even if it happens to be moldy or rotten."
