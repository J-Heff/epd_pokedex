    "It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn\u2019t deal well with Spinda, since it\u2019s always reeling.",
    "It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous gas. When its enemies become disoriented from inhaling the gas, it attacks them.",
    "Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this Pok\u00e9mon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates Salandit\u2019s poisonous gas.",
    "The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can\u2019t evolve."
