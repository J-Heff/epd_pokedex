    "It loves challenging others to tests of strength. It has the power to stop a train with a slap.",
    "They love to compare their freakish strength\u2014 strength enough to send a truck flying with a single slap.",
    "Although they enjoy comparing their strength, they\u2019re also kind. They value etiquette, praising opponents they battle.",
    "Hariyama practices its straight-arm slaps in any number of locations. One hit of this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s powerful, openhanded, straight-arm punches could snap a telephone pole in two.",
    "Hariyama that are big and fat aren\u2019t necessarily strong. There are some small ones that move nimbly and use moves skillfully.",
    "It loves to match power with big-bodied Pok\u00e9mon. It can knock a truck flying with its arm thrusts.",
    "It is known for its fantastic strength, but as it grows older, it focuses more on training Makuhita.",
    "It has the habit of challenging others without hesitation to tests of strength. It\u2019s been known to stand on train tracks and stop trains using forearm thrusts.",
    "Hariyama\u2019s thick body may appear fat, but it is actually a hunk of solid muscle. If this Pok\u00e9mon bears down and tightens all its muscles, its body becomes as hard as a rock.",
    "It stomps on the ground to build power. It can send a 10-ton truck flying with a straight-arm punch."
