    "They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.",
    "It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it\u2019s terrible at swimming straight.",
    "Clauncher\u2019s claws can fall off during battle, but they\u2019ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar.",
    "By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pok\u00e9mon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies.",
    "Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!",
    "Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock."
