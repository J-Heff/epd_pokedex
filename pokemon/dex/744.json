    "As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon can bond very strongly with its Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks.",
    "When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that\u2019s proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!",
    "It\u2019s considered to be a good Pok\u00e9mon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer\u2019s side."
