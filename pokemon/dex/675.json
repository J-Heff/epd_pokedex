    "Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn\u2019t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon is quick to anger, and it has no problem using its prodigious strength to get its way. It lives for duels against Obstagoon.",
    "Using its leaf, Pangoro can predict the moves of its opponents. It strikes with punches that can turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit.",
    "It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take. Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole.",
    "Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won\u2019t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies.",
    "From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it deduces its opponent\u2019s movements. It\u2019s eager to tussle but kindhearted toward its companions.",
    "This rowdy Pok\u00e9mon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character.",
    "It boasts superb physical strength. Those who wish to become Pangoro\u2019s Trainer have no choice but to converse with their fists."
