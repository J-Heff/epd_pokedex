    "The surface of Marshtomp\u2019s body is enveloped by a thin, sticky film that enables it to live on land. This Pok\u00e9mon plays in mud on beaches when the ocean tide is low.",
    "Its toughened hind legs enable it to stand upright. Because it weakens if its skin dries out, it replenishes fluids by playing in mud.",
    "Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made its legs sturdy.",
    "It is at its best when on muddy ground with poor footing. It quickly overwhelms foes struggling in mud.",
    "Its sturdy legs give it sure footing, even in mud. It burrows into dirt to sleep.",
    "Marshtomp is much faster at traveling through mud than it is at swimming. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s hindquarters exhibit obvious development, giving it the ability to walk on just its hind legs."
