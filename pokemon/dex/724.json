    "Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are decided in the blink of an eye.",
    "As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye\u2019s shots never miss.",
    "It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at opponents. When it simply can\u2019t afford to miss, it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus.",
    "In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an arrow quill, piercing an opponent\u2019s weak point before they notice what\u2019s happening.",
    "The air stored inside the rachises of Decidueye's feathers insulates the Pok\u00e9mon against Hisui's extreme cold. This is firm proof that evolution can be influenced by environment.",
    "It fires arrow quills from its wings with such precision, they can pierce a pebble at distances over a hundred yards.",
    "Although basically cool and cautious, when it\u2019s caught by surprise, it\u2019s seized by panic."
