    "If the electric pouches in its cheeks become fully charged, both ears will stand straight up.",
    "As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress.",
    "It can discharge bursts of electricity exceeding 100,000 volts\u2014 a single strike with that amount of power would incapacitate one of the Copperajah of my homeland.",
    "It turns aggressive if it has too much electricity in its body. It discharges power through its tail.",
    "It unleashes electric shocks that can reach 100,000 volts. When agitated, it can knock out even an Indian elephant.",
    "When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimu\u00ad lated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual.",
    "Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint.",

    "Its tail discharges electricity into the ground, protecting it from getting shocked.",

    "Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high voltage power.",
    "It can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size.",
    "If it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down.",
    "When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity.",
    "If its electric pouches run empty, it raises its tail to gather electricity from the atmosphere.",
    "When electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes feisty. It also glows in the dark.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. Raichu searches for electricity by planting its tail in the ground.",
    "Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don\u2019t see this Pok\u00e9mon very often."
