    "The oil-filled tail functions as a buoy, so it\u2019s fine even in rivers with strong currents.",
    "Its body is covered with water-repellent fur. Because of the fur, it can swim through water at high speed without being slowed by the water\u2019s resistance.",
    "Using its tail as a float, it dives underwater. It likes eating plants that grow on river bottoms.",
    "The end of its tail serves as a buoy that keeps it from drowning, even in a vicious current.",
    "The tip of its tail is filled with oil that is lighter than water, so it acts as a float.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon uses its round tail as a float. The ball of Marill\u2019s tail is filled with nutrients that have been turned into an oil.",
    "Even after Marill swims in a cold sea, its water- repellent fur dries almost as soon as Marill leaves the water. That\u2019s why this Pok\u00e9mon is never cold.",
    "The fur on its body naturally repels water. It can stay dry, even when it plays in the water.",
    "The oil-filled end of its tail floats on water. It keeps Marill from drowning even in a strong current.",
    "The tip of its tail, which contains oil that is lighter than water, lets it swim without drowning.",
    "When fishing for food at the edge of a fast-running stream, Marill wraps its tail around the trunk of a tree. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s tail is flexible and configured to stretch.",
    "Marill\u2019s oil-filled tail acts much like a life preserver. If you see just its tail bobbing on the water\u2019s surface, it\u2019s a sure indication that this Pok\u00e9mon is diving beneath the water to feed on aquatic plants."
