    "It has the peculiar power of being able to see emotions such as joy and rage in the form of waves.",
    "It uses waves called auras to communicate with others of its kind. It doesn\u2019t make any noise during this time, so its enemies can\u2019t detect it.",
    "It knows how people and Pok\u00e9mon feel by looking at their auras. It doesn\u2019t approach dangerous opponents.",
    "They communicate with one another using their auras. They are able to run all through the night.",
    "It\u2019s tough enough to run right through the night, and it\u2019s also a hard worker, but it\u2019s still just a youngster.",
    "It uses the shapes of auras, which change according to emotion, to communicate with others.",
    "Though infantile in appearance, it has the mysterious ability to read the minds of humans. The pure of heart are met with Riolu's approval, while those of ill nature earn only its loathing.",
    "It can discern the physical and emotional states of people, Pok\u00e9mon, and other natural things from the shape of their aura waves.",
    "It can use waves called auras to gauge how others are feeling. These same waves can also tell this Pok\u00e9mon about the state of the environment.",
    "It\u2019s exceedingly energetic, with enough stamina to keep running all through the night. Taking it for walks can be a challenging experience.",
    "The aura that emanates from its body intensifies to alert others if it is afraid or sad.",
    "Its body is lithe yet powerful. It can crest three mountains and cross two canyons in one night."
