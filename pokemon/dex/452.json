    "It attacks people and Pok\u00e9mon that cross the desert. This has only furthered its bad reputation.",
    "It has the power in its clawed arms to make scrap of a car. The tips of its claws release poison.",
    "Its body is encased in a sturdy shell. Its head rotates 180 degrees, eliminating blind spots.",
    "Its poison is potent, but it rarely sees use. This Pok\u00e9mon prefers to use physical force instead, going on rampages with its car-crushing strength.",
    "It takes pride in its strength. Even though it can tear foes apart, it finishes them off with powerful poison.",
    "Possessing a sturdy build, it takes pride in its strength, taking down foes without using toxins.",
    "Has a brutish, ferocious temperament. With immense strength and a sturdy shell off which swords will bounce, it rampages about and wreaks havoc.",
    "It\u2019s so vicious that it\u2019s called the Sand Demon. Yet when confronted by Hippowdon, Drapion keeps a low profile and will never pick a fight."
