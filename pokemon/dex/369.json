    "Its form has remained the same for one hundred million years. Its body is filled with fat, so it can withstand the water pressure of the deep sea.",
    "The reason it hasn\u2019t changed at all in a hundred million years is that it\u2019s apparently already a perfect life-form.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon was discovered during deep-sea exploration. Its appearance hasn\u2019t changed in 100,000,000 years, so it\u2019s called a living fossil.",
    "Rock-hard scales and oil-filled swim bladders allow this Pok\u00e9mon to survive the intense water pressure of the deep sea.",
    "It has remained unchanged for 100 million years. It was discovered during a deep-sea exploration.",
    "Discovered by chance during deep-sea explorations, it has not changed since ancient times.",
