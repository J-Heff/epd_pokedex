    "Slugma does not have any blood in its body. Instead, intensely hot magma circulates throughout this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body, carrying essential nutrients and oxygen to its organs.",
    "A common sight in volcanic areas, it slowly slithers around in a constant search for warm places.",
    "These group together in areas that are hotter than normal. If it cools off, its skin hardens.",
    "Molten magma courses throughout Slugma\u2019s circulatory system. If this Pok\u00e9mon is chilled, the magma cools and hardens. Its body turns brittle and chunks fall off, reducing its size.",
    "It is a species of Pok\u00e9mon that lives in volcanic areas. If its body cools, its skin hardens and immobilizes it. To avoid that, it sleeps near magma."
