    "The stench it gives off will make your nose scrunch up. Still, there are Muk fans who think that\u2019s a good thing.",
    "Smells so awful, it can cause fainting. Through degeneration of its nose, it lost its sense of smell.",
    "It\u2019s so stinky! Muk\u2019s body contains toxic elements, and any plant will wilt when it passes by.",
    "As it moves, a very strong poison leaks from it, making the ground there barren for three years.",
    "They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge accumulates, making the stench around them worse.",
    "Its body is made of a powerful poison. Touching it accidentally will cause a fever that requires bed rest.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s favorite food is anything that is repugnantly filthy. In dirty towns where people think nothing of throwing away litter on the streets, Muk are certain to gather.",
    "They love to gather in smelly areas where sludge ac\u00ad cumulates, making the stench around them worse.",
    "Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.",
    "From Muk\u2019s body seeps a foul fluid that gives off a nose-bendingly horrible stench. Just one drop of this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body fluid can turn a pool stagnant and rancid.",
    "Smells so awful, it can cause fainting. Through degeneration, it lost its sense of smell.",
    "It is usually undetectable because it blends in with the ground. Touching it can cause terrible poisoning.",
    "After recent environmental improvements, this Pok\u00e9mon is now hardly seen at all. People speculate that it may go extinct at some point.",
    "A toxic fluid seeps from its body. The fluid instantly kills plants and trees on contact.",
    "Because they scatter germs everywhere, they\u2019ve long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population.",
    "Thickly covered with a filthy, vile sludge. It is so toxic, even its footprints contain poison.",
    "It prefers warm and humid habitats. In the summertime, the toxic substances in its body intensify, making Muk reek like putrid kitchen garbage."
