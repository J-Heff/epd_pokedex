    "Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.",
    "It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.",
    "While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints.",
    "Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches."
