    "Vullaby grow quickly. Bones that have gotten too small for older Vullaby to wear often get passed down to younger ones in the nest.",
    "It protects its plump posterior with the bones of prey it has consumed. As it grows, it  replaces the bones.",
    "It can\u2019t fly yet and must wait until its wings have developed more. Since it\u2019s still at a playful age, it hops around friskily.",
    "Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth spurts. It often has to replace the bones it wears as its size increases.",
    "Mandibuzz gives it the bones it wears. Vullaby\u2019s wings are short, so it can\u2019t fly yet, but it jumps around, dreaming of wide open skies.",
    "Their wings are too tiny to allow them to fly. They guard their posteriors with bones that were gathered by Mandibuzz.",
    "They tend to guard their posteriors with suitable bones they have found. They pursue weak Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Its wings are too tiny to allow it to fly. As the time approaches for it to evolve, it discards the bones it was wearing.",
    "It wears a bone to protect its rear. It often squabbles with others of its kind over particularly comfy bones."
