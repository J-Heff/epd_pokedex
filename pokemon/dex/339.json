    "Barboach uses its whiskers to taste things just as a person uses his or her tongue to taste things.",
    "Its whiskers make a superb radar. They are used to locate prey, even in the murkiest of water.",
    "Its two whiskers provide a sensitive radar. Even in muddy waters, it can detect its prey\u2019s location.",
    "Its body is covered with a slimy film. The film acts as a barrier to prevent germs in muddy water from entering the Barboach\u2019s body.",
    "Its entire body is gooey. When pecked at by bird Pok\u00e9mon, it slips and slides its way to freedom.",
    "Makes its home in swamps with murky water. The poor visibility hides this Pok\u00e9mon from predators, and the slime on its body makes grasping it difficult.",
    "Barboach\u2019s sensitive whiskers serve as a superb radar system. This Pok\u00e9mon hides in mud, leaving only its two whiskers exposed while it waits for prey to come along.",
    "Barboach\u2019s body is covered with a slimy film. If a foe grabs it, this Pok\u00e9mon just slips out of the enemy\u2019s grip. This Pok\u00e9mon grows weak if the slimy coating dries up.",
    "It coats its entire body with a slimy fluid so it can squirm and slip away if grabbed.",
    "Its whiskers are filled with nerves. They can sense smells and flavors just as a person\u2019s nose or tongue would.",
    "It probes muddy riverbeds with its two long whiskers. A slimy film protects its body.",
    "Its slippery body is hard to grasp, so much so that there are festivals where people compete to see how many they can catch barehanded.",
    "Its slimy body is hard to grasp. In one region, it is said to have been born from hardened mud."
