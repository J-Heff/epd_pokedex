    "Rather than using its underdeveloped wings for flight, it rubs them together, producing ultrasonic waves to attack its enemies.",
    "It vibrates its wings to send out odd sound waves. Trainers who are with it need earplugs.",
    "To make prey faint, Vibrava generates ultrasonic waves by vigorously making its two wings vibrate. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s ultrasonic waves are so powerful, they can bring on headaches in people.",
    "It violently shudders its wings, generating ultrasonic waves to induce headaches in people.",
    "It looses ultrasonic waves by rubbing its wings together. Since a Vibrava\u2019s wings are still in the process of growing, it can only fly short distances.",
    "It vibrates its wings vigorously, creating ultrasonic waves that cause serious headaches.",
    "To help make its wings grow, it dissolves quantities of prey in its digestive juices and guzzles them down every day.",
    "It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic waves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries the prey alive in the sand to preserve it.",
    "Vibrava\u2019s wings have not yet completed the process of growing. Rather than flying long distances, they are more useful for generating ultrasonic waves by vibrating.",
    "It generates ultrasonic waves by violently flapping its wings. After making its prey faint, it melts the prey with acid.",
    "The ultrasonic waves it generates by rubbing its two wings together cause severe headaches."
