    "It was resurrected from a fossil using the power of science. It swims by undulating the eight wings at its sides. They were feet that adapted to life in the sea.",
    "Anorith can swim swiftly by pulling its eight wings through the water like oars on a boat. This Pok\u00e9mon is an ancestor of modern bug Pok\u00e9mon.",
