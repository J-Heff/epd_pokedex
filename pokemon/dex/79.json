    "Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they\u2019re a precious ingredient for cooking.",

    "It is always so absent-minded that it won't react, even if its flavorful tail is bitten.",
    "It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won't even notice for a whole day.",
    "Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pok\u00e9mon often forgets what it\u2019s doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water\u2019s edge.",
    "Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail. It does not feel pain if its tail is bitten.",
    "Incredibly slow and sluggish. It is quite content to loll about without worrying about the time.",

    "Its long tail often breaks off. It doesn\u2019t really feel any pain, though, and the tail grows back, so Slowpoke isn\u2019t particularly bothered.",
    "There are some places where Slowpoke is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains.",
    "Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t feel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won\u2019t notice when its tail grows back, either.",
    "Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke tails and then simmering them into a salty stew.",
    "It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about. It is good at fishing with its tail.",
    "A sweet sap leaks from its tail's tip. Although not nutritious, the tail is pleasant to chew on.",
    "When this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s tail is soaked in water, sweetness seeps from it. Slowpoke uses this trait to lure in and fish up other Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "It catches prey by dipping its tail in water at the side of a river. But it often forgets what it is doing and spends entire days just loafing at water\u2019s edge."
