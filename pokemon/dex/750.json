    "It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.",
    "It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it.",
    "Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep.",
    "It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load.",
    "Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat.",
    "Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale\u2019s legs sets harder than stone. It\u2019s so hard that it allows this Pok\u00e9mon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
