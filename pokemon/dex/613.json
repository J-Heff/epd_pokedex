    "When this Pok\u00e9mon is in good health, its snot becomes thicker and stickier. It will smear its snot on anyone it doesn\u2019t like.",

    "Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases.",
    "When it is not feeling well, its mucus gets watery and the power of its Ice-type moves decreases.",
    "Its nose is always running. It sniffs the snot back up because the mucus provides the raw material for its moves."
