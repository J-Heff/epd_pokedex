    "It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby.",
    "Over the course of evolution, its hind legs turned into wings. By alternately resting its front and rear wings, it can fly all day without having to stop.",
    "If this Pok\u00e9mon is flying by fluttering only a pair of wings on either the forelegs or hind legs, it\u2019s proof that Crobat has been flying a long distance. It switches the wings it uses if it is tired.",
    "It feeds on the blood of living people and Pok\u00e9mon. If it can\u2019t drink any blood for even a short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly.",
    "The development of wings on its legs enables it to fly fast but also makes it tough to stop and rest.",
    "Its hind limbs have become another set of wings. Crobat expertly maneuvers its four wings to dart in exquisite fashion through even the most confined caves without losing any speed.",
    "A Pok\u00e9mon that gained vastly enhanced flying performance by having its legs turn into wings.",
    "Having four wings allows it to fly more quickly and quietly so it can sneak up on prey without its noticing.",
    "Both its legs became wings, and as a result, it can\u2019t move well on the ground. All it can do is crawl around.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon flaps its four wings skillfully. Crobat can fly through cramped caves without needing to slow down.",
    "The transformation of its legs into wings made it better at flying, but more clumsy at walking.",
    "Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won\u2019t notice any pain or realize you\u2019ve been bitten.",
    "As a result of its pursuit of faster, yet more silent flight, a new set of wings grew on its hind legs.",
    "Having four wings enables it to fly faster and more quietly. It turns active when the night comes.",
    "Crobat sneaks up on its intended prey using wings that barely make a sound. This Pok\u00e9mon rests by hanging on a tree branch with its rear legs that serve as wings.",
    "Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites down on its prey before they realize what\u2019s happening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood.",
    "Both of its legs have turned into wings. Without a sound, Crobat flies swiftly toward its prey and sinks its fangs into the nape of its target\u2019s neck."
