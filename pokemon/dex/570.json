    "A once-departed soul, returned to life in Hisui. Derives power from resentment, which rises as energy atop its head and takes on the forms of foes. In this way, Zorua vents lingering malice.",
    "It changes so it looks just like its foe, tricks it, and then uses that opportunity to flee.",
    "Zorua is a timid Pok\u00e9mon. This disposition seems to be what led to the development of Zorua\u2019s ability to take on the forms of other creatures.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon has a cowardly disposition, so when it\u2019s not around friends, it basically always stays transformed as something else.",
    "To protect themselves from danger, they hide their true identities by transforming into people and Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "It changes into the forms of others to surprise them. Apparently, it often transforms into a silent child.",
    "Zorua sometimes transforms into a person and goes into cities to search for food. When Zorua does this, it usually takes on the form of a child.",
    "If a normally talkative child suddenly stops talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua."
