    "It nests in caves untouched by sunlight. Its sharp teeth may fall out when worn away or after an impact, but they regrow within a few days.",
    "Gible prefers to stay in narrow holes in the sides of caves heated by geothermal energy. This way, Gible can stay warm even during a blizzard.",
    "It skulks in caves, and when prey or an enemy passes by, it leaps out and chomps them. The force of its attack sometimes chips its teeth.",
    "Gible attacks anything that moves, and it drags whatever it catches into the crevice that is its lair. Despite the big mouth, Gible\u2019s stomach is small.",
    "It reacts to anything that moves\u2014flies right at it and bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it doesn\u2019t care too much.",
    "It nests in horizontal holes warmed by geothermal heat. Foes who get too close can expect to be pounced on and bitten.",
    "Its original home is an area much hotter than Alola. If you\u2019re planning to live with one, your heating bill will soar.",
    "It lives in caves warmed by geothermal heat. Even so, when the weather gets cold, it will huddle close with others of its kind.",
    "It nests in small, horizontal holes in cave walls. It pounces to catch prey that stray too close.",
    "It once lived in the tropics. To avoid the cold, it lives in caves warmed by geothermal heat.",
    "It attacks using its huge mouth. While its attacks are powerful, it hurts itself out of clumsiness, too."
