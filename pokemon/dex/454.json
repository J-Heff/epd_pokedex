    "It has a poison sac at its throat. When it croaks, the stored poison is churned for greater potency.",
    "It bounces toward opponents and gouges them with poisonous claws. No more than a scratch is needed to knock out its adversaries.",
    "The toxin made in its poison sacs is pumped to the knuckle claws through tubes down its arms.",
    "Its knuckle claws secrete a toxin so vile that even a scratch could prove fatal.",
    "The croaking that Toxicroak produces before a battle is for churning the poison it has stored in its poison sac.",
    "It booms out a victory croak when its prey goes down in defeat. This Pok\u00e9mon and Seismitoad are related species.",
    "Its crimson claws contain a virulent toxin. This toxin can be made into a tonic by diluting it, mixing it with several types of wild grass, and boiling it down over two days.",
    "Swaying and dodging the attacks of its foes, it weaves its flexible body in close, then lunges out with its poisonous claws."
