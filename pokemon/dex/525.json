    "If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It\u2019s about to fire off bursts of energy.",
    "When it overflows with power, the orange crystal on its body glows. It looks for underground water in caves.",
    "Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals.",
    "It relies on sound in order to monitor what\u2019s in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it\u2019s facing.",
    "The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.",
    "It explores caves in search of underground water. It\u2019s not comfortable around water, so this Pok\u00e9mon takes great care in lapping it up.",
    "Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They\u2019re valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them.",
    "Its orange crystal is a mass of energy. Just one crystal fragment would provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks.",
    "When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right."
