    "Although it\u2019s rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents.",
    "It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "After hurling ferocious punches and flinging furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by spewing fire from around its navel.",
    "When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames around its waist become especially intense.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon has a violent, selfish disposition. If it\u2019s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its Trainer\u2019s orders with complete nonchalance.",
    "Incineroar\u2019s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pok\u00e9mon shows that it has a kind side as well."
