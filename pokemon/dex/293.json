    "If it senses danger, it scares the foe by crying out with the volume of a jet-plane engine.",
    "It usually murmurs but starts crying loudly if it senses danger. It stops when its ear covers are shut.",
    "Its cries equal a jet plane in volume. It inhales through its ear canals. Because of this system, it can cry continually without having to catch its breath.",
    "The cry of a Whismur is over 100 decibels. If you\u2019re close to a Whismur when it lets out a cry, you\u2019ll be stuck with an all-day headache.",
    "Usually, its cries are like quiet murmurs. If frightened, it shrieks at the same volume as a jet plane.",
    "Normally, Whismur\u2019s voice is very quiet\u2014it is barely audible even if one is paying close attention. However, if this Pok\u00e9mon senses danger, it starts crying at an earsplitting volume.",
    "When Whismur cries, the sound of its own voice startles it, making the Pok\u00e9mon cry even louder. It cries until it\u2019s exhausted, then it falls asleep.",
    "Whismur is very timid. If it starts to cry loudly, it becomes startled by its own crying and cries even harder. When it finally stops crying, the Pok\u00e9mon goes to sleep, all tired out.",
    "It usually murmurs, but starts crying loudly if it senses danger. It stops when its ear covers are shut.",
    "Normally, Whismur\u2019s voice is very quiet - it is barely audible even if one is paying close attention. However, if this Pok\u00e9mon senses danger, it starts crying at an earsplitting volume."
