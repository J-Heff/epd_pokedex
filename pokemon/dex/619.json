    "Though small, Mienfoo\u2019s temperament is fierce. Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks.",
    "They can often be seen in packs in the morning, slowly moving their bodies through a series of poses.",
    "They have mastered elegant combos. As they concentrate, their battle moves become swifter and more precise.",
    "In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop with its arms more than 100 times.",
    "It takes pride in the speed at which it can use moves. What it loses in power, it makes up for in quantity.",
    "They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.",
    "In fights, they dominate with onslaughts of flowing, continuous attacks. With their sharp claws, they cut enemies."
