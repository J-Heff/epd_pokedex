    "Slakoth lolls around for over 20 hours every day. Because it moves so little, it does not need much food. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s sole daily meal consists of just three leaves.",
    "If it eats just three leaves in a day, it is satisfied. Other than that, it sleeps for 20 hours a day.",

    "It sleeps for 20 hours every day. Making drowsy those that see it is one of its abilities.",
    "Slakoth\u2019s heart beats just once a minute. Whatever happens, it is content to loaf around motionless. It is rare to see this Pok\u00e9mon in motion.",
    "It sleeps virtually all day and night long. It doesn\u2019t change its nest its entire life, but it sometimes travels great distances by swimming in rivers.",
    "The way Slakoth lolls around makes anyone who watches it feel like doing the same.",
    "It spends nearly all its time in a day sprawled out. Just seeing it makes one drowsy."
