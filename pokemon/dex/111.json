    "Strong, but not too bright, this Pok\u00e9mon can shatter even a skyscraper with its charging tackles.",

    "Strong, but not too bright, this Pok\u00e9mon can shatter even a skyscraper with its charging TACKLES.",
    "It is inept at turning because of its four short legs. It can only charge and run in one direction.",
    "Its massive bones are 1000 times harder than human bones. It can easily knock a trailer flying.",
    "Rhyhorn runs in a straight line, smashing everything in its path. It is not bothered even if it rushes headlong into a block of steel. This Pok\u00e9mon may feel some pain from the collision the next day, however.",
    "It doesn\u2019t care if there is anything in its way. It just charges and destroys all obstacles.",
    "Its powerful tackles can destroy anything. However, it is too slow witted to help people work.",
    "Rhyhorn\u2019s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.",

    "Ludicrously strong\u2014when it butts heads with a mountain, it is the mountain that shatters. But its short legs struggle with turns, and it is incapable of stopping unless it collides with something.",
    "A Pok\u00e9mon with a one-track mind. Once it charges,  it won't stop running until it falls asleep.",
    "It can remember only one thing at a time. Once it starts rushing, it forgets why it started.",
    "Once it starts running, it doesn\u2019t stop. Its tiny brain makes it so stupid that it can\u2019t remember why it started running in the first place.",
