    "Made from soil, the shell on its back hardens when it drinks water. It lives along lakes.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon becomes more energetic the more sunlight there is. The part resembling a shell is similar to silt and is slightly damp and warm to the touch.",
    "The shell on its back is made of soil. On a very healthy Turtwig, the shell should feel moist.",
    "Photosynthesis occurs across its body under the sun. The shell on its back is actually hardened soil.",
    "It undertakes photosynthesis with its body, making oxygen. The leaf on its head wilts if it is thirsty."
