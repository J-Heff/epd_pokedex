    "It sends signals to others by carving odd patterns in frost- covered trees and ice.",
    "It lives in snowy regions. It carves patterns in trees with its claws as a signal to others.",
    "One Weavile will trip a Sandshrew and flip it over, and then another Weavile will deal the finishing blow with its sharp claws.",
    "With its claws, it leaves behind signs for its friends to find. The number of distinct signs is said to be over 500.",
    "They live in cold regions, forming groups of four or five that hunt prey with impressive coordination.",
    "They communicate by clawing signs in boulders and work together to surround enemies.",
    "Thanks to its increased intelligence, scrapping over food is a thing of the past. A scratch from its claws will give you a case of frostbite!",
    "They dwell in cold places. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s main food source in Alola is Vulpix and Sandshrew, which they carefully divide among their group.",
    "They attack their quarry in packs. Prey as large as Mamoswine easily fall to the teamwork of a group of Weavile.",
    "Evolution made it even more devious. It communicates by clawing signs in boulders.",
    "This species corners prey as a pack, under the guidance of a leader. Weavile displays increased cunning, leading me to speculate that its evolution caused further brain development.",
    "They travel in groups of four or five, leaving signs for one another on trees and rocks. They bring down their prey with coordinated attacks."
