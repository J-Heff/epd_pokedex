    "This Pok\u00e9mon resembles a beautiful flower. A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors.",
    "As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it\u2019s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis\u2019s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby.",
    "The petals on this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if Lurantis gathers light first.",
    "For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pok\u00e9mon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals.",
    "It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals. These beams are powerful enough to cleave through thick metal plates."
