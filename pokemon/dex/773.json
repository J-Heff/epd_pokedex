    "A solid bond of trust between this Pok\u00e9mon and its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within Silvally. It can change its type at will.",
    "Although its name was Type: Null at first, the boy who evolved it into this form gave it the name by which it is now known.",
    "Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask.",
    "Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pok\u00e9mon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle.",
    "The final factor needed to release this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s true power was a strong bond with a Trainer it trusts.",
    "This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased."
