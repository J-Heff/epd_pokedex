    "When it folds up its body and extends its wings, it looks like a jet plane. It flies at sonic speed.",
    "Garchomp makes its home in volcanic mountains. It flies through the sky as fast as a jet airplane, hunting down as much prey as it can.",
    "Its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.",
    "Soars across the heavens at blinding speed\u2014a magnificent sight! It has a feral disposition. Utmost caution is required if one meets a Garchomp out in the wilds.",
    "It flies at speeds equal to a jet fighter plane. It never allows its prey to escape.",
    "Garchomp is fast both underground and above. It can bring down prey and return to its den before its body has chilled from being outside.",
    "It can fly at speeds rivaling jet planes. It dives into flocks of bird Pok\u00e9mon and gulps the entire flock down whole.",
    "Its fine scales don\u2019t just reduce wind resistance\u2014their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent who attacks it.",
    "It flies at the speed of sound while searching for prey, and it has midair battles with Salamence as the two compete for food.",
    "It is said that when one runs at high speed, its wings create blades of wind that can fell nearby trees.",
    "The protuberances on its head serve as sensors. It can even detect distant prey."
