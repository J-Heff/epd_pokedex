    "Its arms are hard as rock. With one swing, it can break a boulder into pieces.",
    "Swampert predicts storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins. If a storm is approaching, it piles up boulders to protect itself.",
    "Its arms are rock-hard. With one swing, they can batter down its foe. It makes its nest on beautiful beaches.",
    "If it senses the approach of a storm and a tidal wave, it protects its seaside nest by piling up boulders. It swims as fast as a jet ski.",
