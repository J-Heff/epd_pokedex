    "When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning or from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a whole day washing its tail in clean spring water.",

    "A clean freak that will not allow even the slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to thoroughly clean any and all filth.",
    "The way it brushes away grime with its tail can be helpful when cleaning. But its focus on spotlessness can make cleaning more of a hassle.",
    "They pet each other with their tails as a form of greeting. Of the two, the one whose tail is fluffier is a bit more boastful.",
    "They greet one another by rubbing each other with their tails, which are always kept well groomed and clean.",
    "These Pok\u00e9mon prefer a tidy habitat. They are always sweeping and dusting, using their tails as brooms."
