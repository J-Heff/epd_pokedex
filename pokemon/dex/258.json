    "In water, Mudkip breathes using the gills on its cheeks. If it is faced with a tight situation in battle, this Pok\u00e9mon will unleash its amazing power - it can crush rocks bigger than itself.",
    "Its power can crush boulders. It rests by covering itself with mud at the bottom of a river.",
    "On land, it can powerfully lift large boulders by planting its four feet and heaving. It sleeps by burying itself in soil at the water\u2019s edge.",
    "To alert it, the fin on its head senses the flow of water. It has the strength to heft boulders.",
    "The fin on Mudkip\u2019s head acts as highly sensitive radar. Using this fin to sense movements of water and air, this Pok\u00e9mon can determine what is taking place around it without using its eyes.",
    "Its large tail fin propels it through water with powerful acceleration. It is strong in spite of its size."
