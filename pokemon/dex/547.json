    "Whimsicott doesn\u2019t live in a fixed location. It floats around on whirling winds, appearing all over the place to perform its mischief.",

    "It rides on the wind and slips into people\u2019s homes. After it has turned a room into a cotton- filled mess, it giggles to itself and takes off.",
    "They appear along with whirlwinds. They pull pranks, such as moving furniture and leaving balls of cotton in homes.",
    "Riding whirlwinds, they appear. These Pok\u00e9mon sneak through gaps into houses and cause all sorts of mischief.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon appears, riding upon the wind. But if the wind gusts up, it\u2019ll blow the cotton on this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s head clean off.",
    "As long as this Pok\u00e9mon bathes in sunlight, its cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it.",
    "It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If it gets wet, it\u2019ll become too heavy to move and have no choice but to answer for its mischief.",
    "Like the wind, it can slip through any gap, no matter how small. It leaves balls of white fluff behind."
