    "Nincada lives underground. It uses its sharp claws to carve the roots of trees and absorb moisture and nutrients. This Pok\u00e9mon can\u2019t withstand bright sunlight so avoids it.",
    "It makes its nest at the roots of a mighty tree. Using its whiskerlike antennae, it probes its surroundings in the pitch-black darkness of soil.",
    "It grows underground, sensing its surroundings using antennae instead of its virtually blind eyes.",
    "Nincada lives underground for many years in complete darkness. This Pok\u00e9mon absorbs nutrients from the roots of trees. It stays motionless as it waits for evolution.",
    "It can sometimes live underground for more than 10 years. It absorbs nutrients from the roots of trees.",
    "Because it lived almost entirely underground, it is nearly blind. It uses its antennae instead."
