    "The amount of electrical energy this Pok\u00e9mon produces is proportional to the rate of its pulse. The voltage jumps while Electivire is battling.",
    "The instant it presses the tips of its tails onto an opponent, it sends over 20,000 volts of electricity into the foe.",
    "It pushes the tips of its tails against its foes and then lets loose a high-voltage current. Its foes are burned to a crisp in an instant.",
    "It grips its tail, which spews electricity, and then beats down opponents with the power of its electrified fist.",
    "A single Electivire can provide enough electricity for all the buildings in a big city for a year.",
    "Heedless of enemy attacks, it closes in, shoves its tails onto the foe, then looses high voltage.",
    "When it gets excited, it thumps its chest. With every thud, thunder roars and electric sparks shower all around.",
    "As its electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.",
    "In terms of electrical-energy output, Electivire is one of the best among all Electric Pok\u00e9mon. It discharges high-voltage currents from its tails.",
    "Its evolution was induced by an unusual item, and its electrical output rises along with its heart rate. From its tails, it can unleash an electric current measuring 20,000 volts.",
    "It pushes the tips of its two tails against the foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power."
