    "Crawdaunt has an extremely violent nature that compels it to challenge other living things to battle. Other life-forms refuse to live in ponds inhabited by this Pok\u00e9mon, making them desolate places.",
    "A brutish Pok\u00e9mon that loves to battle. A veteran Crawdaunt that has prevailed in hundreds of battles has giant pincers marked with countless scars.",
    "Crawdaunt molts (sheds) its shell regularly. Immediately after molting, its shell is soft and tender. Until the shell hardens, this Pok\u00e9mon hides in its streambed burrow to avoid attack from its foes.",
    "A brutish Pok\u00e9mon that loves to battle. It will crash itself into any foe that approaches its nest.",
    "Loving to battle, this Pok\u00e9mon pinches all Pok\u00e9mon that enter its territory with its pincers and throws them out.",
    "A rough customer that wildly flails its giant claws. It is said to be extremely hard to raise.",
    "Its pincers often fall off. Unlike with Crabrawler or Clauncher, the meat in its claws is utterly nasty and stinking.",
    "Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight, but as soon as its pincers break off, it turns cowardly. It stays timid until they grow back.",
    "It is a ruffian that uses its pincers to pick up and toss out other Pok\u00e9mon from its pond."
