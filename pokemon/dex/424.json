    "In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time.",
    "It is very difficult to dodge the consecutive strikes of its two tails.",
    "They live on large trees. They are said to communicate by connecting their tails to those of others.",
    "It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze, that\u2019s proof it really likes you.",
    "To eat, it deftly shucks nuts with its two tails. It rarely uses its arms now.",
    "They work in large colonies and make rings by linking their tails, apparently in friendship.",
    "Split into two, the tails are so adept at handling and doing things, Ambipom rarely uses its hands.",
    "To affirm their kinship, members of this species will form a ring by linking their newly doubled tails together. On rare occasions, humans have been accepted into such rings."
