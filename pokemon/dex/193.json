    "Yanma is capable of seeing 360 degrees without having to move its eyes. It is a great flier that is adept at making sudden stops and turning midair. This Pok\u00e9mon uses its flying ability to quickly chase down targeted prey.",
    "Its large eyes can scan 360 degrees. It looks in all directions to seek out insects as its prey.",

    "It can see 360 degrees without moving its eyes. It is a great flier capable of making sudden stops and turning midair to quickly chase down targeted prey.",
    "It can see in all directions without moving its big eyes, helping it spot attackers and food right away.",
    "It can hover in one spot by flapping its wings at high speed. It flits about to guard its territory.",
    "By flapping its wings at high speed, it can fly freely through the air. Even sudden stops are no problem.",
    "If it flaps its wings really fast, it can generate shock waves that will shatter windows in the area.",
    "Its eyes can see 360 degrees without moving its head. It won\u2019t miss prey--even those behind it."
