    "Galarians favor the distinctive aroma that drifts from this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s leaves. There\u2019s a popular perfume made using that scent.",
    "Just like a plant, it uses photosynthesis. As a result, it is always enveloped in clear air.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s tail is blade sharp, with a fantastic cutting edge that can slice right though large trees.",
    "With cells similar to those of plants, it performs photosynthesis inside its body and creates pure air.",
    "Cells similar to those of plants have been found in its fur. Its hard tail can fell a large tree with one stroke, and the tail's sharpness exceeds even that of a sword crafted by a master.",
    "It basically does not fight. With cells similar to those of plants, it can perform photosynthesis.",
    "The younger they are, the more they smell like fresh grass. With age, their fragrance takes on the odor of fallen leaves.",
    "When you see Leafeon asleep in a patch of sunshine, you\u2019ll know it is using photosynthesis to produce clean air.",
    "Although it doesn\u2019t like disputes, it will sharpen the leaf on its tail into a blade and fight if it has to protect its friends.",
    "It gets its nutrition from photosynthesis. It lives a quiet life deep in forests where clean rivers flow.",
    "Its cellular composition is closer to that of a plant than an animal. It uses photosynthesis to produce its energy supply without eating food."
