    "It has been living with people for so long that portrayals of it can be found on the walls of caves from long, long ago.",
    "Its dense black fur grows continuously. The high cost of keeping its hard fur properly groomed makes this a troublesome Pok\u00e9mon to train.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon obeys its master\u2019s orders faithfully. However, it refuses to listen to anything said by a person it doesn\u2019t respect.",
    "It loyally follows its Trainer\u2019s orders. For ages, they have helped Trainers raise Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "The longer its black fur grows, the harder and more impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can\u2019t easily penetrate it.",
    "It has black, cape-like fur that is very hard and decreases the amount of damage it receives.",
    "The black fur that covers this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body is dense and springy. Even sharp fangs bounce right off.",
    "Herdier is a very smart and friendly Pok\u00e9mon. So much so that there\u2019s a theory that Herdier was the first Pok\u00e9mon to partner with people.",
    "This very loyal Pok\u00e9mon helps Trainers, and it also takes care of other Pok\u00e9mon."
