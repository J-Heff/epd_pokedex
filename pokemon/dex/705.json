    "It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can\u2019t see anything.",
    "Its entire body is covered with gooey mucus that can dissolve anything. Be sure to put gloves on if you\u2019re going to touch it.",
    "Its four horns are a high-performance radar system. It uses them to sense sounds and smells, rather than using ears or a nose.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s mucous can dissolve anything. Toothless, it sprays mucous on its prey. Once they\u2019re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up.",
    "Although this Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t very strong, its body is coated in a caustic slime that can melt through anything, so predators steer clear of it.",
    "It has trouble drawing a line between friends and food. It will calmly try to melt and eat even those it gets along well with.",
    "A creature given to melancholy. I suspect its metallic shell developed as a result of the mucus on its skin reacting with the iron in Hisui's water.",
    "It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with its brain and other organs.",
    "The lump on its back contains its tiny brain. It thinks only of food and escaping its enemies."
