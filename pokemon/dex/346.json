    "Normally, it lived on shallow sea shoals. When the tide went out, this Pok\u00e9mon came up on land to search for prey.",
    "It has short legs and can\u2019t walk very fast, but its neck and tentacles can extend to over three times their usual length to nab distant prey.",
    "It ensnares prey with its eight tentacles. It then melts the prey with a strong acid before feeding.",
