    "It can convert its body into digital data, which enables it to enter cyberspace.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon was created using the cutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so many parts of it have since become obsolete.",
    "It is a manmade Pok\u00e9mon. Since it doesn\u2019t breathe, people are eager to try it in any environment.",
    "An artificial Pok\u00e9mon created due to extensive research, it can perform only what is in its program.",
    "It is a manmade Pok\u00e9mon. Since it doesn't breathe, people are eager to try it in any environment.",
    "It was built 20 years ago by scientists who dreamed of exploring space. Their dreams have yet to come true.",
    "Using the most advanced technologies, scientists finally succeeded in making the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "State-of-the-art technology was used to create Porygon. It was the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon to be created via computer programming.",
    "It is capable of reverting itself entirely back to program data in order to enter cyberspace. A Porygon is copy- protected so it cannot be duplicated.",
    "The only Pok\u00e9mon that people anticipate can fly into space. None has managed the feat yet, however.",
    "A man-made Pok\u00e9mon that came about as a result of research. It is programmed with only basic motions.",

    "In recent years, this species has been very helpful in cyberspace. These Pok\u00e9mon will go around checking to make sure no suspicious data exists.",
    "A Pok\u00e9mon that consists entirely of programming code. It is capable of moving freely in cyberspace.",
    "The only Pok\u00e9mon people anticipate can fly into space. None has managed the feat yet, however.",
    "It has no discernible heartbeat and does not seem to draw breath, and yet it appears to function without issue. I cannot even begin to explain this utterly bizarre anomaly.",
    "Porygon is capable of reverting itself entirely back to program data and entering cyberspace. This Pok\u00e9mon is copy protected so it cannot be duplicated by copying.",
