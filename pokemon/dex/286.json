    "Breloom closes in on its foe with light and sprightly footwork, then throws punches with its stretchy arms. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s fighting technique puts boxers to shame.",
    "It scatters poisonous spores and throws powerful punches while its foe is hampered by inhaled spores.",
    "The seeds on its tail are made of toxic spores. It knocks out foes with quick, virtually invisible punches.",
    "Its short arms stretch when it throws punches. Its technique is equal to that of pro boxers.",
    "The seeds ringing Breloom\u2019s tail are made of hardened toxic spores. It is horrible to eat the seeds. Just taking a bite of this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s seed will cause your stomach to rumble.",
    "It scatters spores from holes in the cap on its head. It loves warm and humid climates. It feeds on trees and plants in fields and forests."
