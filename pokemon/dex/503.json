    "In the time it takes a foe to blink, it can draw and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs.",
    "Hard of heart and deft of blade, this rare form of Samurott is a product of the Pok\u00e9mon's evolution in the region of Hisui. Its turbulent blows crash into foes like ceaseless pounding waves.",
    "Part of the armor on its anterior legs becomes a giant sword. Its cry alone is enough to intimidate most enemies.",
    "One swing of the sword incorporated in its armor can fell an opponent. A simple glare from one of them quiets everybody."
