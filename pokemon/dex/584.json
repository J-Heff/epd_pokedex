    "Vanilluxe is born when two Vanillish, half-melted by the day\u2019s light, stick to each other and freeze together in the cold return of night.",
    "When its anger reaches a breaking point, this Pok\u00e9mon unleashes a fierce blizzard that freezes every creature around it, be they friend or foe.",
    "Swallowing large amounts of water, they make snow clouds inside their bodies and attack their foes with violent blizzards.",
    "Each of its two heads has a brain, and when they are in agreement, it attacks its enemies by exhaling a violent blizzard.",
    "Swallowing large amounts of water, they make snow clouds inside their bodies and, when angry, cause violent blizzards.",
    "People believe this Pok\u00e9mon formed when two Vanillish stuck together. Its body temperature is roughly 21 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "If both heads get angry simultaneously, this Pok\u00e9mon expels a blizzard, burying everything in snow.",
    "It blasts blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, so it gets a lot of love from skiers and snowboarders.",
    "Even if it loses one of its heads, it can live relatively problem-free. It makes snow clouds inside its body."
