    "In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked.",
    "It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten.",
    "The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for Spritzee.",
    "A scent pouch within this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces."
