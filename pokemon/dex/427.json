    "Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust.",
    "When it senses danger, it perks up its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps with its head tucked into its fur.",
    "Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and then striking with the force created by unrolling them. This attack becomes stronger with training.",
    "If both of Buneary\u2019s ears are rolled up, something is wrong with its body or mind. It\u2019s a sure sign the Pok\u00e9mon is in need of care.",
    "It slams foes by sharply uncoiling its rolled ears. It stings enough to make a grown-up cry in pain.",
    "By extending its rolled-up ears and striking the ground, it can bound so high it surprises itself.",
    "You can tell how it feels by the way it rolls its ears. When it\u2019s scared, both ears are rolled up.",
    "Its ears are always rolled up. They can be forcefully extended to shatter even a large boulder.",
    "The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it\u2019s attacked by an enemy.",
    "My hypothesis as to why Buneary rolls up its ears is that its hearing is far too keen. I surmise that the Pok\u00e9mon protects its hearing by limiting the sound that may enter its ears."
