    "One of Doduo\u2019s two heads splits to form a unique species. It runs close to 40 mph in prairies.",
    "It collects data  and plans three times as wisely, but it may think too much and become immobilized.",
    "Uses its three brains to execute complex plans. While two heads sleep, one head is said to stay awake.",

    "When Doduo evolves into this odd breed, one of its heads splits into two. It runs at nearly 40 mph.",
    "Watch out if Dodrio\u2019s three heads are looking in three separate directions. It\u2019s a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don\u2019t go near this Pok\u00e9mon if it\u2019s being wary\u2014it may decide to peck you.",

    "One of DODUO's 2 heads splits to form a unique species. It runs close to 40 MPH in prairies.",
    "Apparently, the heads aren\u2019t the only parts of the body that Dodrio has three of. It has three sets of hearts and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest.",
    "An odd species that is rarely found. The three heads respectively represent joy, sadness, and anger.",
    "If one of the heads gets to eat, the others will be satisfied, too, and they will stop squabbling.",
    "A peculiar Pok\u00e9mon species with three heads. It vigorously races across grassy plains even in arid seasons with little rainfall.",
    "Uses its three brains to execute complex plans. While two heads sleep, one head stays awake.",
    "When DODUO evolves into this odd breed, one of its heads splits into two. It runs at nearly 40 mph.",
    "An enemy that takes its eyes off any of the three heads--even for a second--will get pecked severely."
