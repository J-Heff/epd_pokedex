    "The result of repeated headbutts is a skull grown thick and hard. However, its brain has shrunk in size compared with Cranidos\u2019s.",
    "Very little is known about its biology. Can knock down massive trees by smashing its beautiful, pearl-like crown against them.",
    "This ancient Pok\u00e9mon used headbutts skillfully. Its brain was really small, so some theories suggest that its stupidity led to its extinction.",
    "Its skull is as hard as iron. It is a brute that tears down jungle trees while catching prey.",
    "Records exist of a revived fossil that evolved into Rampardos. It proceeded to escape and then destroy a skyscraper with a headbutt.",
    "In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of this Pok\u00e9mon and use its skull, which is harder than steel, to make helmets.",
    "If two were to smash their heads together, their foot-thick skulls would keep them from fainting.",
    "Its powerful head butt has enough power to shatter even the most durable things upon impact.",
    "Its skull withstands impacts of any magnitude. As a result, its brain never gets the chance to grow."
