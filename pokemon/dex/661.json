    "Despite the beauty of its lilting voice, it\u2019s merciless to intruders that enter its territory.",
    "This amiable Pok\u00e9mon is easy to train. But when battle is joined, it shows its ferocious side.",
    "Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed.",
    "When this Pok\u00e9mon gets excited, its body temperature increases sharply. If you touch a Fletchling with bare hands, you might get burned.",
    "When it\u2019s excited, its temperature can double, spiking hormone production in its body.",
    "Its melodious cries are actually warnings. Fletchling will mercilessly peck at anything that enters its territory.",
