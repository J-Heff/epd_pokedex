    "Known as the Drill King, this Pok\u00e9mon can tunnel through the terrain at speeds of over 90 mph.",
    "More than 300 feet below the surface, they build mazelike nests. Their activity can be destructive to subway tunnels.",
    "It can help in tunnel construction. Its drill has evolved into steel strong enough to bore through iron plates.",
    "It\u2019s not uncommon for tunnels that appear to have formed naturally to actually be a result of Excadrill\u2019s rampant digging.",
    "Forming a drill with its steel claws and head, it can bore through a steel plate, no matter how thick it is."
