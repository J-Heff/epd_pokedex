    "Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pok\u00e9mon and siphons away their vital essence while they\u2019re still alive.",
    "Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pok\u00e9mon snatches away their vitality.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can\u2019t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain.",
    "Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls.",
    "Possessed people controlled by this Pok\u00e9mon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger.",
    "Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained."
