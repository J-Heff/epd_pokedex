    "Even if one of its arms is eaten, it\u2019s fine. The Pok\u00e9mon regenerates quickly and will go right back to normal.",
    "Draped with long vines, it resembles a shrub in appearance. It swings bundles of vines as though they were arms, wrapping them around prey to ensnare them.",
    "When it remains still, it appears to be a large shrub. Unsuspecting prey that wander near get ensnared by its vines.",
    "Tangrowth has two arms that it can extend as it pleases. Recent research has shown that these arms are, in fact, bundles of vines.",
    "It ensnares prey by extending arms made of vines. Losing arms to predators does not trouble it.",
    "Its vines grow so profusely that, in the warm season, you can\u2019t even see its eyes.",
    "Vine growth is accelerated for Tangrowth living in warm climates. If the vines grow long, Tangrowth shortens them by tearing parts of them off.",
    "Its arms are made of plants that bind themselves to things. They grow back right away if cut."
