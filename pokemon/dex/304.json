    "A Pok\u00e9mon that is clad in steel armor. A new suit of armor is made when it evolves. The old, discarded armor is salvaged as metal for making iron products.",
    "When it evolves, it sheds the steel carapace that covered its whole body and develops a new one.",
    "It eats iron to build its steel body. It is a pest that descends from mountains to eat bridges and train tracks.",
    "When Aron evolves, its steel armor peels off. In ancient times, people would collect Aron\u2019s shed armor and make good use of it in their daily lives.",
    "In order to build up its steel body, it eats iron ore. This pesky Pok\u00e9mon is known to eat railroad tracks.",
    "Aron has a body of steel. With one all-out charge, this Pok\u00e9mon can demolish even a heavy dump truck. The destroyed dump truck then becomes a handy meal for the Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon has a body of steel. To make its body, Aron feeds on iron ore that it digs from mountains. Occasionally, it causes major trouble by eating bridges and rails.",
    "It eats iron ore\u2014and sometimes railroad tracks\u2014 to build up the steel armor that protects its body.",
    "It usually lives deep in mountains. However, hunger may drive it to eat railroad tracks and cars."
