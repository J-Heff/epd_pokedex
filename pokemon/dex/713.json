    "At high latitudes, this Pok\u00e9mon can be found with clusters of Bergmite on its back as it swims among the icebergs.",
    "The armor of ice covering its lower jaw puts steel to shame and can shatter rocks with ease. This Pok\u00e9mon barrels along steep mountain paths, cleaving through the deep snow.",
    "The way several Bergmite huddle on its back makes it look like an aircraft carrier made of ice.",
    "Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel. Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that stands in its way.",
    "As Avalugg moves about during the day, the cracks in its body deepen. The Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body returns to a pristine state overnight."
