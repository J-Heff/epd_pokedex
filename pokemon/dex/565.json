    "They can live both in the ocean and on land. A slap from one of them is enough to open a hole in the bottom of a tanker.",
    "Its jaws are terrifyingly powerful. It could eat Omastar and Omanyte whole and not be bothered in the slightest by their shells.",
    "Carracosta completely devours its prey\u2014bones, shells, and all. Because of this, Carracosta\u2019s own shell grows thick and sturdy.",
    "This Pok\u00e9mon emerges from the water in search of prey despite the fact that it moves more slowly on land.",
    "It constructed its sturdy shell by crunching and swallowing the hard shells or bones of its prey.",
    "Incredible jaw strength enables them to chew up steel beams and rocks along with their prey.",
    "It could knock out a foe with a slap from one of its developed front appendages and chew it up, shell or bones and all."
