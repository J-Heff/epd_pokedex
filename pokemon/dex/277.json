    "A Swellow dives upon prey from far above. It never misses its targets. It takes to the skies in search of lands with a warm climate.",
    "Swellow flies high above our heads, making graceful arcs in the sky. This Pok\u00e9mon dives at a steep angle as soon as it spots its prey. The hapless prey is tightly grasped by Swellow\u2019s clawed feet, preventing escape.",
    "Swellow is very conscientious about the upkeep of its glossy wings. Once two Swellow are gathered, they diligently take care of cleaning each other\u2019s wings.",
    "It circles the sky in search of prey. When it spots one, it dives steeply to catch the prey.",
    "It dives at a steep angle as soon as it spots its prey. It catches its prey with sharp claws.",
    "If its two tail feathers are standing at attention, it is proof of good health. It soars elegantly in the sky."
