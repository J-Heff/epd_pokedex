    "It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master\u2019s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.",
    "It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader.",
    "It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can\u2019t help grinning if anyone pats its head.",
    "It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark.",
    "It\u2019s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely.",
    "Wanting to make sure it\u2019s taken seriously, Pancham\u2019s always giving others a glare. But if it\u2019s not focusing, it ends up smiling.",
    "There\u2019s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It\u2019s mischievous, so it\u2019s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers.",
    "It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away."
