    "Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion taught this Pok\u00e9mon how to fight. It dashes across the world, seeking more opportunities to further its training.",
    "By blasting water from its hooves, it can glide across water. It excels at using leg moves while battling.",
    "It crosses the world, running over the surfaces of oceans and rivers. It appears at scenic waterfronts.",
    "When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow.",
