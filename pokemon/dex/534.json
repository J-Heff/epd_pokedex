    "It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago.",
    "Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same.",
    "They use concrete pillars as walking canes. They know moves that enable them to swing the pillars freely in battle.",
    "When going all out, this Pok\u00e9mon throws aside its concrete pillars and leaps at opponents to pummel them with its fists.",
    "Rather than rely on force, they master moves that utilize the centrifugal force of spinning concrete."
