    "A poor walker, it often falls down. However, its strong pride makes it puff up its chest without a care.",
    "Prefers cold climes and appears along coasts. It's an adorable little thing\u2014as cute as any child\u2014but it's also prideful, unwilling to accept handouts from people.",
    "It doesn\u2019t like to be taken care of. It\u2019s difficult to bond with since it won\u2019t listen to its Trainer.",
    "It lives along shores in northern countries. A skilled swimmer, it dives for over 10 minutes to hunt.",
    "Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick down guards it from cold."
