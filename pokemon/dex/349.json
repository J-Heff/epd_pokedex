    "It eats anything, so it can even live in polluted streams and lakes. No one pays any attention to it.",
    "Ridiculed for its shabby appearance, it is ignored by researchers. It lives in ponds choked with weeds.",
    "It is the shabbiest Pok\u00e9mon of all. It forms in schools and lives at the bottom of rivers.",
    "Because of its wretched appearance, most people pay it no attention, but there are some who collect Feebas\u2014and Feebas alone!",
    "It is famous for its shabby appearance. While populous, they tend to cluster in set locations.",
    "It is a shabby and ugly Pok\u00e9mon. However, it is very hardy and can survive on little water.",
    "A tough Pok\u00e9mon that is perfectly fine even in dirty water. However, due to its ragged, shabby appearance, it isn\u2019t popular.",
    "Feebas live in ponds that are heavily infested with weeds. Because of its hopelessly shabby appearance, it seems as if few TRAINERS raise it.",
    "Feebas\u2019s fins are ragged and tattered from the start of its life. Because of its shoddy appearance, this Pok\u00e9mon is largely ignored. It is capable of living in both the sea and in rivers.",
    "Although unattractive and unpopular, this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s marvelous vitality has made it a subject of research.",
    "While Feebas\u2019s body is in tatters, it has a hardy and tenacious life force that enables it to live anywhere. However, this Pok\u00e9mon is also slow and dimwitted, making it an easy catch.",
    "They look ragged, so no one catches them. They look like they\u2019d taste bad, so predators won\u2019t eat them. And their numbers continue to grow."
