    "Although it\u2019s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys.",

    "Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki began appearing in human settlements.",
    "Klefki sucks in metal ions with the horn topping its head. It seems this Pok\u00e9mon loves keys so much that its head needed to look like one, too."
