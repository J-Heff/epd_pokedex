    "Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.",
    "While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.",
    "From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac.",
    "It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you\u2019ll get a shock!",
    "Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around.",
    "Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents."
