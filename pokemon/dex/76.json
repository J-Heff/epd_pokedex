    "Once it sheds its skin, its body turns tender and whitish. Its hide hardens when it\u2019s exposed to air.",
    "It is capable of blowing itself up. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain.",

    "Once it sheds its skin, its body turns tender and whitish. Its hide hardens when it's exposed to air.",
    "Its boulder-like body is extremely hard. It can easily withstand dynamite blasts without taking damage.",
    "It is enclosed in a hard shell that is as rugged as slabs of rock. It sheds skin once a year to grow larger.",
    "Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s course.",
    "It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.",
    "When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss.",
    "Its rock-like body is so durable, even high-powered dynamite blasts fail to scratch its rugged hide.",
    "It is said to live in volcanic craters on mountain peaks. Once a year, it sheds its hide and grows larger. The shed hide crumbles and returns to the soil.",
    "Its body can survive dynamite blasts without a single scratch, but it hates rain and humidity.",
    "Once a year, this Pok\u00e9mon molts, and its shed shell returns to the soil. This process creates enriched soil, so farmers collect the shells.",
    "The rocklike shell is shed each year. The cast-off shell then crumbles, reverting to a mass of soil, which can be spread across fields to promote crop growth.",
    "It sheds its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens and crumbles away.",
    "Golem live up on mountains. If there is a large earthquake, these Pok\u00e9mon will come rolling down off the mountains en masse to the foothills below.",
    "Its boulder-like body is extremely hard. It can easily withstand dynamite blasts without damage.",
    "It sheds its hide once a year. Its boulderlike body is so tough, even dynamite can\u2019t harm it."
