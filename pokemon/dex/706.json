    "Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers don\u2019t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable.",
    "It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that\u2019s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers.",
    "Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies\u2019 attacks slide right off.",
    "Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell. It loathes solitude and is extremely clingy\u2014it will fume and run riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side.",
    "It\u2019s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don\u2019t get mad.",
    "Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.",
    "This very friendly Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime.",
    "It gets picked on because it\u2019s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.",
    "An amazingly friendly Pok\u00e9mon, but if left to itself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes gooey tears."
