    "It blooms during times of strong sunlight. It tries to make up for everything it endured as a bud.",
    "If it senses strong sunlight, it opens its folded petals to absorb the sun\u2019s rays with its whole body.",
    "Motionless, save for the occasional quiver. A rich array of Pok\u00e9mon can be found gathered around it, drawn by the scent exuded from Cherrim's folded petals.",
    "As a bud, it barely moves. It sits still, placidly waiting for sunlight to appear.",
    "During times of strong sunlight, its bud blooms, its petals open fully, and it becomes very active.",
    "Its folded petals are pretty tough. Bird Pok\u00e9mon can peck at them all they want, and Cherrim won\u2019t be bothered at all.",
    "It is docile as a bud, but turns cheerful when it blooms. It folds back into a bud if sunlight wanes."
