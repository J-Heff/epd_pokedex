    "Its steps are staggering and unsteady, but Spinda thinks it\u2019s walking in a straight line.",
    "No two Spinda are said to have identical patterns. It confuses foes with its stumbling motions.",
    "No two Spinda are said to have identical spot patterns on their hides. This Pok\u00e9mon moves in a curious manner as if it is stumbling in dizziness. Its lurching movements can cause the opponent to become confused.",
    "All the Spinda that exist in the world are said to have utterly unique spot patterns. The shaky, tottering steps of this Pok\u00e9mon give it the appearance of dancing.",
    "The chances of two Spinda having identical spot patterns is less than one in four billion.",
    "Each Spinda\u2019s spot pattern is different. With its stumbling movements, it evades opponents\u2019 attacks brilliantly!",
    "Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a long time makes it feel sick.",
    "Each and every Spinda has a slightly different configuration of spots. There are collectors who enjoy the tiny differences in their spot patterns.",
    "It is distinguished by a pattern of spots that is always different. Its unsteady, tottering walk has the effect of fouling its foe\u2019s aim.",
    "No two Spinda have the same pattern of spots. Its tottering step fouls the aim of foes."
