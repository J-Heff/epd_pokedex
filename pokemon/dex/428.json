    "An extremely cautious Pok\u00e9mon. It cloaks its body with its fluffy ear fur when it senses danger.",
    "Its fur is warm and yet remarkably light. This Pok\u00e9mon kicks as though it were a master of karate, driving back its opponents with ease.",
    "Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers and hats made from its fur are really warm.",
    "It is very conscious of its looks and never fails to groom its ears. It runs with sprightly jumps.",
    "The ears appear to be delicate. If they are touched roughly, it kicks with its graceful legs.",
    "It sheds its fur twice a year. Its winter fur is soft and fluffy.",
    "It\u2019s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting, but at the same time, it can deliver powerful kicks with its lithe legs.",
    "Extremely cautious, it quickly bounds off when it senses danger.",
    "Lopunny is constantly monitoring its surroundings. If danger approaches, this Pok\u00e9mon responds with superdestructive kicks.",
    "Once hot seasons are over, Lopunny\u2019s coat will be replaced with fur that holds a lot of insulating air in preparation for colder weather."
