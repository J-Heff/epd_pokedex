    "This Pok\u00e9mon has covered its body in a hard shell that has the same composition as bone. Shelgon stores energy for evolution.",
    "Covering Shelgon\u2019s body are outgrowths much like bones. The shell is very hard and bounces off enemy attacks. When awaiting evolution, this Pok\u00e9mon hides away in a cavern.",
    "It hardly eats while it awaits evolution. It becomes hardier by enduring hunger. Its shell peels off the instant it begins to evolve.",
    "The cells within its shell transform with explosive speed, preparing it for evolution.",
    "Within its rugged shell, its cells have begun changing. The shell peels off the instant it evolves.",
    "Shelgon ignores its hunger entirely, never eating any food. Apparently, Shelgon will evolve once all its energy stores are used up.",
    "Inside Shelgon\u2019s armor-like shell, cells are in the midst of transformation to create an entirely new body. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s shell is extremely heavy, making its movements sluggish.",
    "Shelgon lives deep within caves. It stays shut up in its hard shell, dreaming of the day it will be able to fly.",
    "They lurk deep within caves\u2014motionless, neither eating nor drinking. Why they don\u2019t die is not known.",
    "Its armored body makes all attacks bounce off. The armor is too tough, however, making it heavy and somewhat sluggish.",
    "The cells within its body are changing at a bewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from the same substance as bone.",
    "It surrounds its body in an iron-hard shell to accumulate enough power to evolve."
